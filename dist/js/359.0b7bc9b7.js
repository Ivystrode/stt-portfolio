More information is needed to determine whether this is due to the "eliciting customer requirements" or the "pitch effectively" part of the question (or both), since I have been making a deliberate effort to be quieter and speak less. This is partly down to my own insecurity over my default tone of voice, which I am worried may come across as too aggressive or assertive when I don\'t necessarily mean to convey that attitude.
